# Polymer viewer

Goal: To make an app that offers an automation comparison for a selected type of polymer among others!

The app consists of three functional parts:
1) Parsing: collecting data from external sourse
2) Data base: storing data in the database
3) Visualization: presenting data in a dash app accoriding to selected parameters and a database content

Used libraries and tools: 
- UI (dash, plotly; Figma)
- Code (numpy, pandas, logging, pytest)
- Database (psycopg2; pgAdmin 4, PostgreSQL, Lucidchart)

# Hot to use
(The project doesn't work without the local database)
1) Download the app code
2) Run the app.py
3) Open the app locally that is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
